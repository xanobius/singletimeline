# Single Timeline Display

## Performance:
It's still very slow in. Possible Improvements:
- Work with plain timestamps instead of Carbon-Instances
- Work with a few Carbon singletons (we still could use some nice features)

## Possibilities
Caching! Use the generated Maps and cache them. Generate new maps on Changes affecting the maps.
